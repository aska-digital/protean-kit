# CHANGELOG

Dated, per-upgrade log for the Team6-kit public repo. Each entry states what
changed, **why** it changed, and the **evidence/source class** behind it.

Evidence classes used throughout:

- **[VERIFIED — internal operating record]** — grounded in a durable internal
  operating record of the running Team6 fleet (the team's shared doctrine and
  dated session history). These are the team's own derived rules.
- **[VERIFIED — public conceptual source]** — grounded in a public source we
  link to below; adopted as a *principle*, never by copying code, prompts,
  anti-slop lists, or text.
- **[PROPOSED / PENDING]** — named intent, no durable spec yet. Flagged so a
  reader never mistakes it for completed doctrine.

Licensing note that applies to the whole upgrade: the Erlang/OTP documentation,
`karpathy/autoresearch`, and `NousResearch/autonovel` are referenced as
**conceptual sources only**. Their principles are summarized with attribution;
no source code, prompts, anti-slop lists, or prose is copied into this repo.
`autoresearch`'s README declares MIT but ships no committed `LICENSE` file, and
`autonovel` ships no committed `LICENSE` — both are therefore treated as
weaker-than-committed grants and used for concept only. See `LICENSING.md`.

v1.2.0 licensing note: **Desert Ant is referenced as an optional implementation
only, never bundled.** This repo does not copy Desert Ant code, model files, or
license text. Desert Ant models carry a separate source-available vendor
license that is distinct from the Apache-2.0 kit layer and does not extend to
it. See `choreography/local-preprocessing.md` and `LICENSING.md`.

v1.2.0 hosting note (canonical-site decision): the **official public Team6 site**
is https://team6.askaconsult.com. The repository is the source of truth at
https://github.com/ahrazzle/team6-kit. GitHub Pages is not used and the old
Pages site was taken down. The canonical site carries visible navigation back to
https://askaconsult.com/digital/. The deployment and DNS boundary is managed
outside this repository.

## Unreleased

- **What:** re-pin the six drifted ingredient pins in `kit.lock.json` from their live remote tags (fixes #11). The ingredient repositories' published histories were rewritten and their release tags re-pointed after the pins were taken, so every fresh install failed with an integrity error (exit 4) while warmed machines kept passing. New peeled commit shas, read from the remote rather than from a local cache: `protean-doctrine` v1.1.0 -> `838f71ea00139bc79643ee5625523733bdf0652d`, `protean-ops` v1.1.0 -> `f278db48e8e58f3107df8fd1391c4a145e5ffea0`, `protean-drafts` v1.0.0 -> `c091210c296bad9366cb6e4bb7ebf531d6bc40e3`, `protean-github-flow` v1.0.0 -> `4995e4dfad21744440f485554c5db52c1c9cac14`, `protean-sym2p` v1.0.0 -> `43334b2fa756b11481a7c021931870864f95ea71`, `protean-control-plane` v1.1.0 -> `6c7e8f8e7b13c882a37e2cd0847ecdc17dc489cb`. The rewrite was content-preserving: `treeSha256`, `fileCount`, contract line, and `installTargets` are unchanged for all six, so only the `sha` fields move. `protean-handoff` v1.0.0 and `protean-context` v0.1.0 were already current and are untouched. `generatedAt` moves to the re-pin date.
- **Why:** a cold-cache `bash install.sh --all` could not install the kit at all; the lock named commits that no published ref reaches.
- **Also in this change:** `build/check-lock.py --verify` now reports each pin's verification provenance (`remote`, `cache`, or `ingredients-dir`) and re-resolves every tag against the remote even when a warm cache entry sits at the pinned sha, failing closed when the published tag has moved. `--verify --offline` keeps passing on warm caches but says plainly that the remote tag pairing was not re-resolved, so a local cache can never present itself as a published-release verification.
- **Evidence class:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record]; the new shas were read from the remotes and their `protean-tree-v1` hashes recomputed against freshly fetched trees.
- **Verification:** `python3 build/check-lock.py kit.lock.json --verify` passes (all eight pins at provenance `remote`); a fixture reproducing the issue's warm-cache scenario now fails closed where the pre-fix code passed; `python3 build/verify-all.py`, `tests.test_kit_lock`, and `tests.test_contribution_mode` all pass.
- **Open item:** the cold-cache acceptance install now clears every integrity check but stops at exit 5 inside the `protean-ops` ingredient's own `op-contrib-state` gate: its example `CONTRIB-STATE.md` carries a grant that expired 2026-09-24. That is the ingredient's content, not the composer's; it needs a `protean-ops` release and a follow-up re-pin, outside this change. The installer's closing README line (noted in #11) is likewise untouched as adjacent, out-of-scope observation.

- **What:** add an install-time contribution-mode toggle to the composer. The installer takes
  `--contribution-mode off|on` (default `off`) and, when switching on, a required
  `--operator-ref <reference>`. After a successful install it writes the contribution-state
  record at `records/CONTRIB-STATE.md`, rendered from the `protean-ops` ingredient's own
  installed template, and it never overwrites an existing record.
- **Why:** external contribution is a public side effect, so the mode that permits it belongs to
  the operator and needs a default that fails safe. The composer is where a fresh machine decides
  it, so the question and its safe answer belong here, documented beside the command that asks
  it.
- **Default and refusal:** mode `off` writes a record that reads as off and changes no other
  behavior; mode `on` without `--operator-ref` exits 1, because a permission that a flag alone can
  widen has no audit trail; mode `on` without the ops ingredient in the selection exits 5 rather
  than inventing the schema. The choice is a flag, not an environment variable, so it is recorded
  and reviewable rather than ambient.
- **Evidence class:** [VERIFIED - internal operating record] for the mode contract and the
  bounded values it refers to; the toggle itself is exercised here by
  `tests/test_contribution_mode.py` (8 cases: default off, refusal without a reference, an unknown
  mode, the recorded switch row, no overwrite of an existing record, mode on with no template,
  mode off with no template, and the dry run).
- **Verification:** `python3 -m unittest tests.test_contribution_mode` and
  `python3 -m unittest tests.test_kit_lock` pass from a clean checkout of this commit, and
  `python3 build/check-lock.py kit.lock.json` still passes. The workflow gains one step that runs
  the new test file.
- **Open item:** the pins in `kit.lock.json` are not re-pointed by this change. The three
  ingredients it refers to (doctrine, ops, control-plane) carry the matching changes on their own
  branches, so the re-pin follows their release tags rather than this commit. Until then the
  composer installs the current pins and the toggle renders whatever template that pinned ops
  version ships.

- **What:** add the composition lock and the installer. `kit.lock.json` pins six
  standalone ingredients by annotated tag, peeled commit SHA, and tree hash
  (`protean-tree-v1`). `install.sh` (a thin entrypoint over `build/install.py`)
  resolves a selection, computes the hard `requires` closure, fetches and
  verifies each pin, stages and installs in dependency order, and reads every
  written file back. Two gates join the release run: `build/check-lock.py` and
  `build/check-ingredient-contract.py`. Exit codes are fixed at `0` to `6`, and a
  partial install is never reported as success. The composer contains no
  ingredient payload and no submodule.
  **Why:** the kit needs one command that installs the whole set, an install that
  can be verified rather than trusted, and a manifest that a reader can audit
  without executing anything.
  **Evidence class:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record]; the loader,
  the target, and the exit codes were exercised by `tests/test_kit_lock.py`
  against fixture repositories.
  **License:** the composer zone model is unchanged; each pinned ingredient is
  MIT under its own committed `LICENSE` file. See `LICENSING.md`.

- **What:** add the anti-loop discipline contract. It defines four rules to prevent
  thinking loops: load once then use, read once then act, plan once then execute,
  and trust tool output as the receipt. Published artifacts and live pages still
  require read-back because the deployed state can differ from local state.
- **Why it changed:** agents can enter thinking loops that add zero new information
  but consume model budget and time. The previous system had no guard against
  redundant operations.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record] grounded in the team's shared
  doctrine and dated session history.

- **What:** add the self-improving flywheel contract (`choreography/self-improving-flywheel.md`).
- **Why it changed:** without it, each incident is treated as a one-off and the team
  relearns the same lesson; root causes stay in session history and do not
  become encoded rules that prevent recurrence.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record]

- **What:** add the open-source contribution contract (`choreography/open-source-contribution.md`).
- **Why it changed:** without it, patches are written on design preference or
  assumptions rather than proven defects, risking rejection, wasting time, and
  potentially exposing internal context.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record]

- **What:** correct the canonical-site labels in the README. The canonical
  public documentation site for Team6-kit is `team6.askaconsult.com`; the
  ASKA corporate page at `www.askaconsult.com/team6` is the service listing.
  The README previously called the corporate page the "official site" and
  the canonical site the "technical guide".
- **Why it changed:** the README labels contradicted the v1.2.0 canonical-site
  decision recorded below, which names `team6.askaconsult.com` as the official
  public Team6 site. No code, layout, or route behavior changed.

- **What:** document a resume-channel redirect. A finished one-shot worker
  leaves its session saved on disk, so a follow-up command can run one bounded
  turn into that same session and exit. A /steer-prefixed follow-up is accepted
  as instruction text. Follow-ups are scoped read-only unless the turn owns
  files. Attaching to a session whose worker is still alive is prohibited.

- **Why it changed:** without a defined channel, a correction after a finished
  run meant starting a new session, which duplicated context, or attaching to a
  session that might still be running, which risked two live writers on one
  receipt boundary. One documented command closes the gap.

- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED, internal operating record] mechanism and scope were
  verified on a completed session on 2026-09-14 (internal QA record,
  E-PROTEUS-008). The steering block is patched into the subagent-spawning
  skill as the procedure's home.

---

## 1.6.0 — Verification, evidence, and release gates (2026-09-14)

- **What:** add a deterministic release gate runner at `build/verify-all.py`
  that runs all public gates in documented order: sweep-gate, review-gate,
  surface-scan, check-artifact-contract self-test, preflight/check self-test,
  report/check self-test, and fresh-clone generation test. Also add GitHub
  Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/verify.yml` that runs the gates on
  push and pull requests with Python 3.11 and 3.12, using only checkout and
  setup-python actions (safe for forks, no secrets). Fix a blind spot in
  surface-scan: when `build/identifiers.yaml` is absent or empty, the scanner
  still enforces built-in generic safety terms (paths, credential patterns)
  that must never appear in public code. Add tests for verify-all and the
  empty-identifiers case. Update README.md and index.html to document the
  release gates and CI status.

- **Why it changed:** need a single point of entry for verification that runs
  all gates automatically, with CI integration that catches problems before
  merge. The empty-identifiers fix ensures the scanner remains effective in
  fresh clones and open-kit scenarios.

- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record] gates, checkers, and
  self-tests exist and pass; workflow tested on local execution.

- **Files:** `build/verify-all.py`, `.github/workflows/verify.yml`,
  `build/surface-scan.py`, `tests/test_gates.py`, `README.md`, `index.html`.
### Contract-validator gate integration (2026-09-14)

- **What:** wires the kit's contract validators into the fresh-clone gate.
  A new aggregator script (`build/check-contracts.py`) runs four validators
  in sequence: artifact-contract validator (`--self-test`, `--example-check`),
  preflight validator (`--selftest`), and report validator (`--selftest`).
  The fresh-clone script (`scripts/fresh-clone-test.sh`) now includes this
  as step 5, validating that the working tree's contract validators are
  operational. All validators are stdlib-only, require no network or
  credentials, and fail closed on errors.
- **Why:** Ensures the contract validation gates are always exercised as part
  of the reproducible fresh-clone test, catching regressions in validator
  logic before deployment. The gate validates the working tree; clone
  reproducibility remains steps 1–4.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record] The validators are
  already tested and proven in the fleet. Integration into the fresh-clone
  gate makes this a standard, automated checkpoint.
- **Proof status:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record] Self-tests pass
  locally; the fresh-clone gate completes with step 5 enabled.
- **Files:** `build/check-contracts.py`, `scripts/fresh-clone-test.sh`,
  `README.md`, `index.html`.

---

### Execution-evidence contract (2026-09-13)

- **What:** adds `choreography/run-evidence.md`, defining a vendor-neutral
  contract for recording execution evidence: what an agent actually executed,
  not only that a procedure ran. Evidence record fields include run id, phase,
  parent/child relations, step kind, tool/model identifiers, timestamps, status,
  artifact references, unresolved items, and evidence boundary. Distinguishes
  procedure evidence from achieved-state evidence (exit code alone insufficient).
  Token accounting counts only innermost spans; cost honesty uses dated price
  table (unknown models remain unknown); run comparison uses stable step keys
  (kind + tool/name); retention is bounded with dropped-count visibility; no
  secrets/raw prompts by default; local/loopback guidance. Includes acceptance
  checklist and vendor-neutral example record.
- **Why:** Team6 has read-back receipts and logs but no local, framework-agnostic
  artifact of what the agent actually executed (span tree, tool calls, tokens,
  latency, per-model cost) nor a way to diff two runs step-by-step. This is the
  one genuine capability gap identified in the local-agent-toolkit audit.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record] local-agent-toolkit audit
  (2026-09-13) identifies observability as the one real gap. This release
  implements the rules-only adaptation (no external code copied).

- **Files:** `choreography/run-evidence.md`, `README.md`, `index.html`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

### OpenShorts route (2026-09-14)

- **What:** docs-only OpenShorts route + non-executable example config; no new dependencies; no bundled code; external tool license and dependency terms apply.
- **Files:** `choreography/openshorts-route.md`, `registry/openshorts-route.yaml.example`, README, CHANGELOG, index.html.

### Safe shareable run packet (2026-09-13)

- **What:** add a general safe shareable run packet: `choreography/safe-run-packet.md`
  (required fields for objective, decisions, verified evidence, unresolved items,
  changed artifacts, test results, runtime/live status, next gate, provenance, and
  redaction status; a placeholder convention; and a shareable-surface safety rule)
  and `build/report/check.py`, a standard-library-only validator with valid and
  invalid fixtures that fails closed on a missing required field, evidence marked
  verified without evidence, a live/staged status without target or evidence,
  omitted unresolved items, an internal local path or profile path, a
  credential-like value, or a placeholder outside the repository convention. The
  generator seam is left untouched in this slice; the authored files ship through
  the same authored-fresh mechanism when registered.
- **Why it changed:** a finished run must produce one artifact a second person can
  read and share — what was attempted, what was decided, what is actually
  verified, what is still open, what changed, how it was tested, whether anything
  reached a live surface, and what happens next — without leaking an internal path,
  a profile identity, or a credential value.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — public conceptual source] the general idea of an
  Agency Orchestrator-style run report, adopted as a concept. This is a
  conceptual operating pattern, **not copied Agency Orchestrator code**: no
  source, prompt, or dependency from any orchestrator project is bundled. The
  Team6 Kanban board remains the authoritative task record; the packet is a
  derived shareable report, not a second state store, and adds no runtime
  integration, provider call, or configuration change.
- **Proof status:** [PROPOSED / PENDING] documentation contract plus local
  validator; independent review required before treating it as release policy.
- **Files:** `choreography/safe-run-packet.md`, `build/report/` (README, checker,
  fixtures), `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Goal-state evidence guidance (2026-09-13)

- **What:** add one operating rule to `choreography/artifact-contract.md`:
  evidence must prove the achieved target state, not merely that a command or
  procedure ran. A verifier rejects procedure-only evidence.
- **Why it changed:** a passing command does not prove the requested state was
  reached. Adjudicating a handoff on procedure execution alone lets an
  unachieved target state through.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — public conceptual source] the state-versus-procedure
  framing is inspired by Levin, M., "Ingressing Minds: Causal, Non-Physical
  Patterns In-Form Natural, Synthetic, and Hybrid Embodiments," Philosophies
  11(5), 161 (2026), https://doi.org/10.3390/philosophies11050161. Adopted as a
  framing for evidence sufficiency only. The paper's metaphysical and ontology
  claims are not adopted, cited, or relied on.
- **Proof status:** [PROPOSED / PENDING] documentation rule; repository gates
  and independent review required before release.
- **Files:** `choreography/artifact-contract.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

### I/O delegation contract (2026-09-13)

- **What:** add a public, vendor-neutral `choreography/io-delegation.md`
  contract and `registry/io-delegation.yaml.example` example config. It
  documents a bounded routing pattern for two narrow work classes — predictable
  read-heavy summarization and pattern-conforming scaffolding — while the
  frontier agent keeps edits, debugging, architecture, security/safety-critical
  work, ambiguous requirements, and final acceptance. Route identity reuses the
  provider/model/API-host rules in `choreography/model-policy.md`; input must
  pass the local privacy/redaction policy in
  `choreography/local-preprocessing.md` first; default mode is `observe` with no
  invented quotas; worker output is advisory and ephemeral; and every delegation
  records route, input/output byte counts, latency, status, fallback, and
  verification result without raw sensitive content. Documentation and an
  example config only — no executable hooks, network clients, model
  dependencies, or profile-specific settings are added.
- **Why it changed:** a large-file offload pattern can reduce frontier-context
  cost, but it carries real risks (sensitive-data leak, context loss, latency,
  shallow summaries). The counterargument is met by making it an **opt-in,
  bounded, audited contract** that is never automatic merely because a file is
  large and never delegates the work that must stay on the frontier agent.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — public conceptual source] Spotify Engineering
  article "Portal by Spotify cut my Claude Code token usage by 90%"
  (engineering.atspotify.com, 2026-09-03) describing a routing principle that
  keeps frontier reasoning for edits/debugging/architecture/safety-critical
  work and routes predictable I/O-heavy work to a cheaper worker. Adopted as a
  principle only — no code, prompts, or source copied; the linked `shunt`
  plugin is Apache-2.0 at `spotify/portal-ai-plugins@main/plugins/shunt` but is
  referenced for the routing principle, not imported. The 90% figure is a
  **self-reported vendor claim**, not Team6 evidence: Team6 adopts only the
  routing principle and does not claim this result.
- **Proof status:** [PROPOSED / PENDING] Team6-kit documentation change;
  fresh-clone gates and independent review required before release.
- **Files:** `choreography/io-delegation.md`, `registry/io-delegation.yaml.example`,
  and the README overview.

### Side-effect and cost preflight (2026-09-13)

- **What:** add a general side-effect and cost preflight: `choreography/side-effect-cost-preflight.md`
  (required fields for operation identity, files changed, external systems, credential
  names only, paid operations, estimated quantity/cost units, conditional `may_run`
  actions, public surfaces, bounded rollback, owner/approval state, explicit unknowns)
  and `build/preflight/check.py`, a standard-library-only validator with valid and
  invalid fixtures that fails closed on missing required fields, credential values,
  unbounded waits, or missing rollback for side-effecting operations. The generator
  ships these authored public files through its authored-fresh mechanism (verbatim
  copy, no manifest row, no placeholder substitution; the audit count closes against
  disk).
- **Why it changed:** an operation with side effects needs one reviewable
  description before it runs: what it touches, what it spends, and how to undo
  it. Unknown cost stays explicit and conservative; quotas are never invented.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own conceptual operating pattern for
  side-effect and cost preflight. No external code, prompt, or dependency is
  bundled. The Team6 Kanban board remains the authoritative task record; the
  preflight is a review aid, not a runtime integration, and adds no provider
  call, paid operation, or configuration change.
- **Proof status:** [PROPOSED / PENDING] documentation contract plus local
  validator; independent review required before treating it as release policy.
- **Files:** `choreography/side-effect-cost-preflight.md`,
  `build/preflight/` (README, checker, fixtures), `build/generate.py`,
  `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

### AI-assisted development contract (2026-09-13)

- **What:** add a tool-neutral contract for AI-assisted changes: explicit scope
  and acceptance criteria, behavior-first boundary/error testing,
  security-sensitive checks, isolated parallel work, and independent evidence
  read-back.
- **Why:** the public `jnMetaCode/ai-coding-guide` offers useful methods and
  templates, but Team6 needs a smaller contract that preserves its existing
  ownership, no-secret, QA, and verification rules. The source is used for
  conceptual guidance only; no external template or executable surface is
  bundled.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — public conceptual source] `jnMetaCode/ai-coding-guide`,
  snapshot `c5dde338c68adaac6cffc70ab11f1b1b22e70b0f`; adapted and reviewed in
  PR #5 (see [LICENSING.md → AI-assisted development contract boundary](LICENSING.md#ai-assisted-development-contract-boundary-unreleased-2026-09-13)).
  Root source license is Apache-2.0; the source's `book/` content is separately
  identified as CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and is not used.
- **Files:** `choreography/ai-assisted-development.md` and the README overview.

## 1.5.0 — Artifact contract and resume/feedback handoff (2026-09-13)

### Machine-checkable handoff contracts

- **What:** add a generic handoff-contract format and its dependency-free
  validator. One file per stage boundary carries: expected artifacts,
  required sections/markers, size bounds, tests/commands, evidence refs,
  runtime state (`local` / `staged` / `live`), explicit failure state, last
  stable phase, resume phase, feedback to apply, artifacts to regenerate, and
  artifacts **not** to touch. Ships as `choreography/artifact-contract.md`
  (format + rules), `templates/contracts/artifact-contract.md.tmpl` (fill-in
  template), `build/check-artifact-contract.py` (validator + 16-case
  self-test), and valid/invalid examples in `examples/`. The generator ships
  all five under `contracts/` in the instantiated kit. No second orchestration
  runtime is added: the checker validates the *document*, never executes a
  pipeline.
- **Why it changed:** resumed and review-cycle handoffs kept failing at the
  artifact level even though `orchestration.md` §6/§7/§11 already demand
  durable state, read-back receipts, and producer-committed signals —
  finished work got redone, approved artifacts got silently rewritten, and
  "done" claims carried no machine-checkable evidence. The missing piece was
  a *checked* format, not another stated norm.
- **Provenance:** this is a Team6 internal operating record for artifact
  handoffs. The pattern was designed by Team6 to solve resume/feedback
  boundary issues in Kanban workflows; it is not derived from external code
  or documentation, and no external orchestration code, prompts, or prose
  are bundled. The field set, parser, and rules are Team6's own generic
  form. **Team6 Kanban remains the state authority** — the contract is a
  per-handoff snapshot written out of the Kanban record, never a
  replacement for it.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — internal operating record] the fleet's
  resume/handoff failure classes (read-then-die, STABLE-marker deadlock,
  silent rewrites — see the 1.1.0 item 13 record). [VERIFIED] the checker's
  self-test: 16/16 pass, including a missing-required-field case that fails
  and a complete contract that passes, and both repo examples validate to
  their expected verdicts (valid → exit 0, invalid → exit 1 for the
  missing `resume_phase` and the illegal `runtime_state` enum). Public files
  contain generic names only; the full 8-surface leak scan passes.
- **Files:** `choreography/artifact-contract.md`,
  `templates/contracts/artifact-contract.md.tmpl`,
  `build/check-artifact-contract.py`, `build/generate.py` (contracts/ copy
  step), `examples/artifact-contract.{valid,invalid}.yaml`, README, CHANGELOG.

---

## 1.4.1 — Router trust-boundary and tool-execution safety (2026-09-13)

- **What:** add `choreography/router-security.md`, a vendor-neutral preflight
  contract for model routers and relays. It covers endpoint and upstream-path
  trust, credential minimization, high-risk tool gates, autonomous execution,
  metadata-only audit logs, and conditional or dependency-targeted tampering
  tests. It provides a generic checklist for evaluating whether a router or
  relay meets the team's safety requirements before it is enabled.
- **Why it changed:** routers and relays can see plaintext requests and
  responses, and may sit between a model provider and the tools an agent runs.
  Without a trust boundary, there is no shared checklist for endpoint trust,
  credential handling, high-risk tool gates, autonomous execution, audit
  logging, or tampering tests. The new contract provides one.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own conceptual operating pattern for
  router trust boundaries. No external code, prompt, or dependency is
  bundled. The Team6 Kanban board remains the authoritative task record; the
  contract is a review aid, not a runtime integration, and adds no provider
  call, paid operation, or configuration change.
- **Proof status:** [PROPOSED / PENDING] documentation contract plus local
  validator; independent review required before treating it as release policy.
- **Files:** `choreography/router-security.md` and the README overview.

## 1.4.0 — Dynamic model-policy catalogue (2026-09-13)

### Route-based rate-limit protection

- **What:** add a route-based model-policy catalogue (registry/model-rate-limits.yaml.example
  and choreography/model-policy.md) for tracking provider limits per model,
  API host, and provider. It supports bounded admission, protected reserves,
  and observe-only mode for unknown limits.
- **Why it changed:** models move between agents, tasks, and workers. Without
  a unified policy, the team risks hitting unknown limits or inventing quotas.
  A route-based policy that follows the model by provider, identifier, and host
  solves this.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own conceptual operating pattern. No
  external code, prompt, or dependency is bundled. The Team6 Kanban board
  remains the authoritative task record.
- **Files:** `registry/model-rate-limits.yaml.example`, `choreography/model-policy.md`,
  and the README overview.

## 1.3.0 — Handover ingestion completeness & propagation loop (2026-09-12)

**Convention note:** The audit artifacts named by the original 1.3.0 record are not present in the current tree. The entries below preserve the conceptual history of that release; no current path is asserted for those historical files.

### 1. A handed-over source is not reference-only until it is audited

- **What:** a source handed over from another team or external party must go
  through a structured audit: ownership review, capability matrix, disposition
  classification, surface validation, and propagation through each surface's
  own gate.
- **Why:** without a structured audit, handed-over sources accumulate
  unclassified references, duplicate content, or orphan surfaces that never
  propagate to the full surface set.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own operating procedure from real
  handovers (the original 1.3.0 audit trail is not carried in this tree; see the convention note above).

### 2. The audit inspects surfaces, not the README

- **What:** the audit inspects the full surface set (README, CHANGELOG, registry,
  templates, choreography) and validates each against the candidate. It does
  not rely on README references alone.
- **Why:** references in the README do not guarantee the full surface set is
  complete or correct.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own operating procedure.

### 3. Capability matrix, owner, and disposition

- **What:** each handed-over candidate gets a capability matrix (what it covers,
  what it omits), an owner (who is responsible for it), and a disposition
  (adopt, adopt with caveats, or discard).
- **Why:** without these, candidates accumulate without clear ownership or
  disposition.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own operating procedure.

### 4. Separate the five phases

- **What:** handover audits follow five phases: intake, capability matrix,
  disposition, surface validation, and propagation. Each phase is recorded
  in the handover audit file.
- **Why:** separating phases makes handovers auditable and reproducible.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own operating procedure.

### 5. Bounded proof, receipts, and read-back

- **What:** each phase produces bounded proof (audit artifacts, surface
  inventory, propagation receipts) and requires a read-back to validate
  that the candidate is understood and correctly applied.
- **Why:** without proof and read-back, handovers are opaque and error-prone.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own operating procedure.

### 6. Preserve unresolved, dead, and blocked

- **What:** the audit preserves unresolved items, dead candidates, and blocked
  work in the handover record, with disposition and owner for each.
- **Why:** without preservation, candidates lose context and accumulate without
  resolution.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own operating procedure.

### 7. Propagation through each surface's own gate

- **What:** validated content propagates through each surface's own gate (README,
  CHANGELOG, registry, templates, choreography) and each gate is recorded in
  the handover audit.
- **Why:** without gate-by-gate propagation, content accumulates without
  consistency across surfaces.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own operating procedure.

### 8. One capability delta per candidate, routed by impact class

- **What:** each candidate produces one capability delta (what changes) routed
  by impact class (documentation, configuration, or code). Each delta is
  reviewed and signed off separately.
- **Why:** without routing by impact class, deltas accumulate without
  consistent review.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own operating procedure.

## 1.2.0 — Desert Ant local preprocessing (2026-09-11)

- **What:** add `choreography/local-preprocessing.md` (Desert Ant reference
  architecture for local privacy/redaction). This is guidance only.
- **Why:** agent inputs can leak sensitive content or cost-inefficient data.
  Local preprocessing (redaction, cost filters, content pruning) protects
  privacy and cost before they reach an external provider.
- **Evidence:** [VERIFIED — public conceptual source] Desert Ant reference
  architecture (desert-ant/desert-ant repo, Apache-2.0). Used for concept only;
  no code, prompt, or dependency is bundled.
- **Files:** `choreography/local-preprocessing.md`.

## 1.1.0 — Local privacy/redaction policy (2026-09-10)

- **What:** add `choreography/local-preprocessing.md` (local privacy/redaction
  policy). This is guidance only — no runtime or dependency is added.
- **Why:** agent inputs can leak sensitive content or cost-inefficient data.
  Local preprocessing (redaction, cost filters, content pruning) protects
  privacy and cost before they reach an external provider.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own conceptual operating pattern.
- **Files:** `choreography/local-preprocessing.md`.

## 1.0.0 — Initial release (2026-09-01)

- **What:** initial release of Team6-kit, a framework for turning a single AI
  agent engine into a multi-agent team with clear rules and responsibilities.
- **Why:** to provide a reference implementation for multi-agent team
  orchestration with clear contracts, QA gates, and provenance tracking.
- **Evidence:** [Internal design] Team6's own conceptual operating pattern.
- **Files:** Initial commit.
